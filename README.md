Summary of project:
A 2D video game, a unity based project. Simple WASD player control to avoid obstacles and collect coins to advance to the next stage. 
Stacks used:
UNITY, c# scripts, Unity Asset Pipeline

Live Demo:
https://hideonfruit.itch.io/
This link includes a variety of games I created using unity including 2D and 3D games with multiple level and stages. 
(Code for those projects is not hosted on GitHub, but they are fully playable demos.)

Instructions to run locally:
Clone the repo
Download as zip
Launch Unity editor
Import this project to unity editor
Open the project folder as unity project
Go to scenes folder

Managing scene transitions and keeping assets linked properly
Managing the script and changing values for player input to ensure smooth gameplay

Gained experience in unity assest pipeline
Learnt C# scripting

In terms of career:
This adds a Unity project with code to my portfolio strengtening it
Elevates both my coding and game design skills which will help me in further game development projects and works

Future plans:
Creating more 3D games with more stages and different diffuclty level for flexibility
Introducing enemies and npc
Story mode plot for interactivity and keeping the user engaged.
Save and load system.

I acknowledge using ChatGPT for the following tasks:
to help structure and draft this README. I then used the guidelines to reflect my actual project details and portfolio links.
some surprising benefits of using GPT include the following:
Clear structure and things to include when creating a draft. In depth explanation and guidelines on what to include and emphasize in this writing.
